# Blockspace

Once, it should be a game about flying through a vast, blocky space. Now it's just a demo, that could be more, if I would invest more time in it.

But it is a nice show case for the [BahaviorTree](http://github.com/Calamari/BehaviorTree.js) implementation. Just look into the `assets/javascripts/ai` folder for the definition of behaviors and the `assets/javascripts/levels.js` for the usage.
